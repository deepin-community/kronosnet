	[transports] remove unused internal ACL API
	with the new ACL code, this internal API is no longer used

	[acl] major internal rework
	ACL internal management was somewhat broken and didn´t really

	- fix ACL to be truely per host/link as public API advertise
	- move ACL checking when host/link are known
	- add extensive tests

	[lib] Don't use -rpath
	rpath seems, understandably, to annoy some analysis tools. We
	use it to locate the crypto & compression plugins but libknet also needs
	to use the plugins from the build-tree when running tests.

	A simple way to do this is have the plugin directory as part of the knet
	handle then we can override it in the test suite, which already does
	'illegal' accesses to some handle fields.

	OK, it's not the MOST elegant way of doing this perhaps, but it is
	simple and effective.

	[tests] rework test suite link port allocation
	Logic is to try to configure a link with port X and if it fails, try the next

	Please note that the implementation in test-common.c is NOT super clean.
	There is still some redundant code in there that is left on purpose.

	There is another branch, not yet merged, that implements functional testing
	framework that does heavy use of those functions.

	We will clean test-common.c as we port the functional testing branch and make
	it ready for merging.

	[tx] Don't Clear out msghdr for all transports.
	When sending a message to multiple links, if one of those links
	is not connection-oriented then msg_name & msg_namelen would be cleared,

	If recvmsg() returns 0 for EOF then it's going to do so

	thus returning a block of 512 EOF messages all of which the caller

	This patch causes _recvmmsg() to return as soon as it has got
	the first EOF so the the caller can deal with it in good time

	(To reproduce this try starting corosync with 2 links configured in
	corosync.conf but only one of them configured to the 'right' address
	- it will spin in a tight loop and need to be killed with -9)

	[RX] handle short write to the application properly
	this change affects only applications that are not using knet
	generated socketpairs to deliver/receive data to/from knet.

	If an application uses a fd that is not SOCK_SEQPACKET (basically
	streaming), we have to handle short writes accordingly, and knet
	will continue delivering as long as there is progress.

	The application is responsible to verify that the data packet
	is complete as the delivery is not guaranteed to be complete.
	The application can either embed the size of the packet in their
	data structure or use the socket error notification callback
	that will be invoked in case of errors or 0 data delivery.

	[PMTUd] invalidate MTU for a link if the value is lower than minimum
	Under heavy network load and packet loss, calculated MTU can be

	[test] add ability to knet_bench to specify a fixed packet size for perf test

	[rx] copy data into the defrag buffer only if we know the size of the frame

	[host] fix defrag buffers reclaim logic
	The problem:

	- let's assume a 2 nodes (A and B) cluster setup
	- node A sends fragmented packets to node B and there is
	  packet loss on the network.
	- node B receives all those fragments and attempts to
	  reassemble them.
	- node A sends packet seq_num X in Y fragments.
	- node B receives only part of the fragments and stores
	  them in a defrag buf.
	- packet loss stops.
	- node A continues to send packets and a seq_num
	  roll-over takes place.
	- node A sends a new packet seq_num X in Y fragments.
	- node B gets confused here because the parts of the old
	  packet seq_num X are still stored and the buffer
	  has not been reclaimed.
	- node B continues to rebuild packet seq_num X with
	  old stale data and new data from after the roll-over.
	- node B completes reassembling the packet and delivers
	  junk to the application.

	The solution:

	Add a much stronger buffer reclaim logic that will apply
	on each received packet and not only when defrag buffers
	are needed, as there might be a mix of fragmented and not
	fragmented packets in-flight.

	The new logic creates a window of N packets that can be
	handled at the same time (based on the number of buffers)
	and clear everything else.

	[links] stabilize latency calculation when nodes are not responsive
	The following scenario is more of a corner case than normal, but
	this change allows to better deal with this situation:

	1) 2 nodes cluster (corosync) (node A and node B)
	2) kill -stop $(pidof corosync) on node A
	3) node B will continue to send ping packets to node A
	4) node A is accumulating those ping packets in the kernel network socket
	5) wait some seconds and unpause node A
	6) node A will start processing the ping packets in the queue
	   and send pong replies to node B
	7) node B will see an extreme increase of latency due
	   those "obsoleted" ping/pong packets
	8) node B, as latency increases, will take longer and longer
	   to notice that node A is down due to the pong_timeout adjustment
	   for latency (required for initial cluster spike).

	the solution:

	1) Use average latency to calculate pong_timeout_adj vs latency_max.
	   Averate latency will go down again in time, while latency_max is never
	   reset.

	2) RX thread will filter out all pong packets that have higher latency
	   than currently configure pong_timeout. This barrier should have
	   been in place even before.

	this solution reduces the latency spike on node B to a perfectly
	reasonable level and it will all eventually stabilize over time
	as latency samples increase and latency will reduce.

	Please be aware that using a pong_timeout smaller than latency will
	simply mark the link down now.

	[handle] Set thread stack size on create
	Musl libc has small stack size for threads. Knet needs ~300KiB (tested
	at the time when this patch was created). Glibc seems to use ~8MiB. As a
	compromise, 1MiB is used.

	[common] Conditionalize RTLD_DI_ORIGIN
	RTLD_DI_ORIGIN is used to get absolute path of plugin. It is used only
	for logging useful info and not strictly needed, so use it only when it
	is defined (only musl is known to author of the patch)

	[common] Include correct errno.h
	sys/errno.h is system-specific path and errno.h should be used instead.

	[build] bump soname to indicate new API call

	[PMTUd] add ability to manually override MTU and disable PMTUd

	[PMTUd] add dynamic pong timeout when using crypto
	problem originally reported by proxmox community, users
	observed that under pressure the MTU would flap back and forth
	between 2 values due to other node response timeout.

	implement a dynamic timeout multiplier when using crypto that
	should solve the problem in a more flexible fashion.

	When a timeout hits, those new logs will show:

	[knet]: [info] host: host: 1 (passive) best link: 0 (pri: 0)
	[knet]: [debug] pmtud: Starting PMTUD for host: 1 link: 0
	[knet]: [debug] pmtud: Increasing PMTUd response timeout multiplier to (4) for host 1 link: 0
	[knet]: [info] pmtud: PMTUD link change for host: 1 link: 0 from 469 to 65429

	[knet]: [debug] pmtud: PMTUD completed for host: 1 link: 0 current link mtu: 65429

	and when the latency reduces and it is safe to be more responsive again:

	[knet]: [debug] pmtud: Starting PMTUD for host: 1 link: 0
	[knet]: [debug] pmtud: Decreasing PMTUd response timeout multiplier to (64) for host 1 link: 0
	[knet]: [debug] pmtud: PMTUD completed for host: 1 link: 0 current link mtu: 65429

	....

	testing this patch on normal hosts is a bit challenging tho.

	[PMTUd] rework the whole math to calculate MTU
	internal changes:
	- drop the concept of sec_header_size that was completely wrong
	  and unnecessary
	- bump crypto API to version 3 due to the above change
	- clarify the difference between link->proto_overhead and
	  link->status->proto_overhead. We cannot rename the status
	  one as it would also change ABI.
	- add onwire.c with documentation on the packet format
	  and what various len(s) mean in context.
	- add 3 new functions to calculate MTUs back and forth
	  and use them around, hopefully with enough clarification
	  on why things are done in a given way.
	- heavily change thread_pmtud.c to use those new facilities.
	- fix major calculation issues when using crypto (non-crypto
	  was not affected by the problem).
	- fix checks around to make sure they match the new math.
	- fix padding calculation.
	- add functional PMTUd crypto test
	  this test can take several hours (12+) and should be executed
	  on a controlled environment since it automatically changes
	  loopback MTU to run tests.
	- fix way the lowest MTU is calculated during a PMTUd run
	  to avoid spurious double notifications.
	- drop redundant checks.

	user visible changes:
	- Global MTU is now calculated properly when using crypto
	  and values will be in general bigger than before due
	  to incorrect padding calculation in the previous implementation.

	We may not want to actually use SCTP after all, and if we do, we won't
	get to use the uninitialized subscribe struct anyway.  Thus aborting
	handle initialization is premature here.

	Fix nozzle man dates to SOURCE_EPOCH, just like we fix the libknet ones

	Import key with length not dividable by wrap key block size
	Wrapping of the key is standard crypto operation which needs data
	aligned to cipher block size, otherwise it fails.

	Possible solution is to use a zero filled buffer with size aligned to
	required wrap key block size. Private key is copied to the beginning of
	the buffer and unwrap operation keeps using only required private key
	size.

	Use gitarchive-version for spec file

	Do not match lightweight tags in git-version-gen
	Fix leftover from 175b517fd71d999150aa701ec847510490a18a6e which added
	matching of lightweight git tags.

	Support for git archive stored tags
	Attempt to solve problem with git archive generated tarballs
	(used for example by github when release is downloaded) which are no
	longer git tree and (in contrast to officially released tarballs) also
	doesn't contain .tarball-version file so git-version-gen script simply
	cannot obtain valid version info.

	Solution is based on using gitattributes which is instructs git to
	replace string in the .gitarchivever file by known ref names.
	git-version-gen is enhanced to support this file and tries to parse
	any string which looks like "tag: v[0-9][^,)]*". If such string
	is found it's used as a version. This file is used as a last attempt and
	other methods (.tarball-version, git abbrev) have precedence.

	Based on idea stated by Jan Pokorný <jpokorny@redhat.com>.

	The info components carry the real OS-independent library version
	information, from which the version number is computed differently

	For now, the only supported flag is KNET_HANDLE_FLAG_PRIVILEGED,
	which is also the default in knet_handle_new().

	The tests are adapted to switch this flag off, which makes them pass

	doxyxml: use AM_CFLAGS for debugging info, optimization and warnings
	The rework of the FLAGS handling and the development of doxyxml happened
	on different temporary branches, and this slipped through on the merge.

	tests: skip the SCTP test if SCTP is not supported by the kernel
	For example, module loading is disabled on Debian build daemons.

	build: --export-dynamic is needed for dlopened modules only
	Not that it matters on ELF platforms the least.  If Kronosnet is ever
	ported to Windows, however...

	build: linking with libm is unnecessary on some systems (like OS X)
	Inlining of builtin functions can eliminate the libm dependency on other
	systems as well, but AC_SEARCH_LIBS can't detect this because it tests
	with a false prototype.  Thus we use --as-needed linking already to trim
	such unnecessary dependencies.

	build: use --as-needed to avoid unnecessary dependency on libm
	I removed --as-needed in 1b96703, but now I found a good reason to use
	it after all.

	build: check for the --enable-new-dtags flag before using it

	build: sanitize CFLAGS handling
	As for LDFLAGS previously: leave the CFLAGS "user variable" untouched to
	enable easy selective overriding of the flags used by the build system.

	Using $lt_prog_compiler_pic shouldn't be necessary, let's drop it and
	see if anything breaks. WERROR_CFLAGS was undefined, so dropped as well.

	build: we preserve CPPFLAGS, just remove the tempting hooks

	build: sanitize LDFLAGS handling
	The Automake manual states that according to the GNU Coding Standards
	the so-called "Variables reserved for the user" mustn't be changed by
	the build system, and they must override the default settings from the
	build system.  The "Flag Variables Ordering" section provides the
	recipes on which we build here.

	Using $lt_prog_compiler_pic directly shouldn't be necessary, let's try
	leaving it out.

	build: LIBS belong to LDADD for binaries

	build: remove unused DEBUG Automake conditional

	[PMTUd] drop (now) unnecessary and dangerous usleep
	prior to all threads being able to notify PMTUd of EMSGSIZE errors,
	we had this random usleep in there to have time to collect data.
	It was working at the time, but it's a bad idea.

	On super large clusters (>66 nodes) with 4 links on each node, when
	applying heavy load (cpghum on all nodes at once), the average latency
	between nodes can increase so much that the PMTUd thread usleep
	could literally block corosync for seconds at a time.

	Drop the usleep and live happily ever after

	[PMTUd] reset value or suffer the pains of DEADLOCKING! errno is per thread, not per function

	[PMTUd] only notify PMTUd when pmtud_running and don't force a run to avoid lock fighting

	if PMTUd is running.

	Also, don't request an immediate rerun as we cannot guarantee that the scheduling
	is favourable to our request and we could end up waiting forever.

	[PMTUd] make PMTUd force_run notification more quiet

	[PTMUd] if any threads receives a EMSGSIZE outside of a PMTUD run, force PTMUd to run
	Scenario:

	node X has MTU Y on the interface and application is sending packets with size >= Y.

	The interface MTU is suddenly reduced to < Y

	Before this change, the kernel would be dropping packets till the next PMTUd run.

	After this change, the PMTUd will be informed that it has to rerun (overriding
	the pmtud_interval), reducing the packet drop to a minimum.

	How to test:

	force knet_bench to send 1500 size packets with ping_data (requires code change)
	and start it.

	reduce MTU on the interface from 1500 to 1300 (for example)

	Notice an immediate trigger of PMTUd run in debug mode

	Note: going up, from 1300 to 1500 will wait for the next PMTUd re-run as there
	is no immediate way to detect this change unless we start listening to kernel
	netlink sockets with libnl3 (investigation in progress but not critical enough atm).

	[PMTUd] rename pmtud_running to pmtud_waiting

	[PTMUd] by using a safe PMTU to init a link, we can shave down corosync membership creation by 25%
	tested on a 9 node cluster with 2 links each node, going down from 4 seconds to 3 seconds

	[PMTUd] Use kernel MTU information to determine next packet size during discovery
	Using this information we can, for good links (*), determine and verify the link
	MTU with 2 packets.

	* good links means:
	node X has MTU Y configured on a given interface. Any network object between node X
	and destination is capable of handling MTU >= Y.
	In no case the kernel will allow us to send packets > Y.

	[PMTUd] fix external API and PMTUd interaction

2017-12-18  Fabio M. Di Nitto  <fdinitto@redhat.com>

	[PMTUd] fix external API and PMTUd interaction
	The problem:

	PMTUd can take a long time to release the global read lock, mostly due
	to the pthread_cond_timedwait required to ack/nack packets from the
	other hosts. This delay could block any wrlock operation for several seconds
	if not more.

	The solution:

	each call to the global pthread_rwlock_wrlock has been changed to a wrapper
	that will notify the PMTUd to interrupt its operations (and restart) first,
	then get a global write lock that is queued as soon as PMTUd is going out.

	This solution also improves a lot shutdown speed.

	How to test:

	This is not super simple to test and verify. I used 2 VMs with known MTU of
	1500. Start knet_bench on both (normal ping_data -C is more than enough).
	Once they have established data exchange, change the MTU on one of the nodes
	to 1600 (or higher). This should guarantee that the PMTUd process will take
	a very long time to complete.
	First verify that the PMTUd process takes several seconds.
	Once the next PMTUd run starts, hit ctrl+c on the node that is executing
	the PMTUd and the process should exit much faster than before this patch.

	[PMTUd] fix multiple issues and stability problems

2017-12-14  Fabio M. Di Nitto  <fdinitto@redhat.com>

	[PMTUd] fix multiple issues and stability problems
	- resolve locking issue with thread_heartbeat that was causing
	  spurious up/down link event.
	  In the event of a PMTUd run taking too long, the heartbeat
	  thread could hang for much longer than ping_timeout.
	  Use backoff_mutex to sync between threads instead of the global lock.

	- pause the DATA tx thread when sending any PMTUd related packets.
	  Similar method as knet_send_sync, using the tx_mutex, allows a much
	  more stable communication between nodes without any visible performance
	  hit.

	- calculate higher timeouts when using crypto to improve stability

	- fix an odd race condition with the kernel where, during a single PMTUd run,
	  the same packet size was marked both BAD and GOOD (via EMSGSIZE) by the
	  kernel. That situation would cause our PMTUd to run away and calculate
	  bad values.

	- add a minor usleep between sending PMTUd packets to give time to the
	  kernel to make its own mind about the link PMTU. This is based on average
	  latency.

	- since PMTUd can take several seconds before completion, use the "end time"
	  to record the last run vs the start time.

	- fix a major issue in sending PMTUd reply where an errno was not being
	  passed down the link layer and would cause the RX thread to block forever.

	Make the bzip2 compress plugin a proper module
	Our current practice of dlopening foreign shared libraries is problematic
	for several reasons:
	* not portable: modules and shared libraries can be different object types
	* dependency information is invisible (our canaries mostly solve this)
	* hardwiring SONAMES breaks on transitions (KNET_PKG_SONAME solves this)
	* symbol versioning information is lost (theoretically solvable)

	The preferred way out is generating dynamically loaded private modules
	from the main source, which then rely on the dynamic linker to load the
	external symbols as usual.

	Separate compress_model_t definition into a new header file
	We'll use this type together with the zlib headers, which clash with

	When running knet+openssl+valgrind on x86_64, with high pthread_cond_timedwait

	to the point that the internal knet RX thread is not scheduled for minutes.
	At that point all processes will go kaboom (heartbeat, PMTUd, etc) almost constantly
	failing this test.

	Given that all other architectures and OSes can run this test happily, I am adding

	[build] workaround memory alignment bug in nss in combination with valgrind on Linux/i386
	Over the past few weeks, we noticed CI failing on i386 when running make check-memcheck
	(test suite executed with valgring). Those failures were not consistent and sometime random.

	After some heavy debugging it turns out that those failures are a combination of libnss3
	internal memory allocator bug and valgrind internal memory allocator.

	Current libnss3 memory allocator expects a 16 bytes memory aligned
	buffer and in the event the memory is not aligned, it would round it.
	The issue is that, in performing this rounding, nss does not track properly the
	original address of the memory, and the equivalent of subsequent free of this buffer
	would fail, leaking memory and potentially accessing memory not allocated or corrpting
	memory.

	The nss bug is already fixed upstream by commit: changeset:   13557:52e38f913220

	Valgrind on Linux/i386 memory allocator can return memory that is not aligned to the 16 bytes,
	contrary to what malloc/glibc does. Valgrind was returning (somehow randomly) a non aligned
	buffer to nss triggering the nss bug and the leak.

	By forcing valgrind to use aligned memory, nss bug does not trigger and there is no memory leak
	during the execution of the test suite.

	The memory leak never triggered when running knet in normal conditions.

	link: Only mark a link as 'configured' when it actually is
	If the transport-specific config fails then the link can be left

	the rest of the values in case the transport-specific code wants

	I don't particularly enjoy the use of host detection in configure.ac,
	but there is no easier way to set the library names for dlopen without
	some complex and fragile scripts.

	BSD valgrind + nss complains about some non-initialized memory access.
	being internal to nss we can ignore it.

	on BSD i386 size of time_t is int32_t vs all other platforms where is int64_t.
	BSD doesn't appear to be offerign any PRIx conversion and since it's contained
	within the testsuite only (for printf purposes), cast and get away with it.

	[udp] fix incorrect return code
	UDP TX is tricky and racy and in theory TX never fails, as UDP is allowed
	to drop packets internally anyway.

	In some race condition situations, we can endup in a situation where:
	- thread X attempts to send a packet
	- socket receives an ICMP back (for whatever reasons) generated
	  by some other random thread/packet combo
	- thread X detects an error in TX and decode the error (correct)

	pre patch:
	- thread X would treat that as error and drop the packet
	post patch:
	- thread X should simply resend the packet

	simply also the ordering of parsing socket error code to make it easier to read

	[handle] remove knet handle tracker
	reload of shlib should be done on a per handle base to avoid complex
	global functions.

	For example, if you application is using 2 knet_h and you need to reload
	libbz2, then switch both knet_h to use another compression method (or none)
	and switch back to libbz2.

	Similar can be done with nss/openssl once openssl support is added.

	A global function to reload all library would a very complex error reporting
	mechanism and could leave some handles improperly configured.

	The application would have a better understanding of the needs at any given
	time.

	[crypto] fix libnss unload crash and remove that atexit horror show

	[crypto] fix libref count the same way as compress

	[compress] centralize handling of libref in compress abstraction layer
	the complexity come from a mix and match of those modules that
	have/don't have .is_init/.init functions, and makes handling
	more delicate.

	This commit ensures that:
	- library is loaded only once (makes load_lib mandatory for every modules)
	- use knet_h->compress_int_data to track per handle init.
	  modules providing .is_init,.init don't need set anything there
	  unless they need to.
	- modules don't need to track libref anymore but they must
	  provide a unload_lib/load_lib.
	- library are closed only once libref is 0.

2017-07-28  Jan Pokorný  <jpokorny@redhat.com>

	[build] release.mk: reflect current release publishing practice
	Core author(s) had previous affiliation with project hosting on
	fedorahosted.org,  but since the sunset of that hosting[1], it's no
	longer an option.

	Unfortunately, publish-by-scp convenience of fedorahosted.org won't fly
	with GitHub that insists on the (primarily REST) API to get things
	automated, so update "publish" recipe to that effect, providing some
	hints on possible adaption of the process.

	Also, turn "git push --tags" to a bit safer "git push --follow-tags"
	for good measure.

	[1] https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BWSMCGZPPNG3JOCFQ6Z74MIBU7FG3KGB/

	[build] release.mk: simplify the default goal, declare .PHONY targets
	The default goal line now serves mainly the documentation purpose,
	otherwise it could be squashed down to "sign" target.

	[build] release.mk: move soft guard for no GPG key up the supply chain
	It also means the missing key specification is now a hard error when
	ASCII armored files are to be created (directly or by other rules).

	Leveraging the previous commit, it is now unnecessary to guard against
	release mode not being requested, so this guard is dropped completely
	in the transition, allowing for the full-fledged (incl. GPG signing)
	release delivery testing without mangling with in-tree tags.

	To allow "sign" target to (possibly eventually) become the implicit goal
	even if "gpgsignkey" variable is explicitly unspecified, make it depend
	on $(deliverables).

	[build] release.mk: fix no-release conflict (implied-required version)
	Previously, generating custom versioned tarballs without requiring
	a "release" (which comprises also tagging hence in turn making the
	implied version match the required one as desired) would not allow
	to test the release routines thoroughly incl. GPG signing.
	Unfortunately, allowing for a temporary tag is prone to accidentally
	slipping it to the distributed tree, so that should rather be avoided
	Now it can.

	Another step to blur the boundaries between whether "release" is
	specified or not is to make checksums file generated unconditionally.

	Also both pre-existing and the newly created (per the above scenario)
	"overhead" files arising from make/release.mk are git-ignored properly.

	[build] release.mk: simplify/generalize GPG signing rule
	...especially in case we want to easily switch to signing also
	particular archives, which may be a reasonable expectation from some
	downstream/distro maintainers (as demonstrated with the libqb's
	example[1] where this changeset was picked from a followup PR[2],
	respectively its adaptation for fence-agents[3]).
	Since this commit, such a change is a matter of only swapping
	a prerequisities specification for "sign" target per the commented
	out suggestion.

	For that to work reliably even after such a change, for the complete
	dependency backtrack, though, a pre-existing issue with parallelized
	work on the prerequisites needs to be fixed first.  The (currently
	hypothetical) problem is "tarballs" (phony) target missing in the
	linearized supply chain for the signed tarballs, as opposed to supply
	chain for the checksums file that can be worked on in an (unordered!)
	interleave with the work on these signed tarballs.  Hence fix this
	(currently hypothetical) race condition by stretching "tarballs" target
	as progress barrier (using it as a prerequisite) uniformly for all
	the deliverables that are going to be signed (as opposed to the
	currently only "sha256" target).  And when at it, make "deliverables"
	variable list them conveniently (along with reformatting definitions
	of other variables for uniformity).

	[knet.h] Reduce KNET_MIN_KEY_LEN
	By reducing KNET_MIN_KEY_LEN we allow FIPS enabled system using NSS to
	import (unwrap) the key.

	[nsscrypto] Use different method to import key
	PK11_ImportSymKey doesn't work when FIPS is enabled because NSS is
	targeting to FIPS Level 2 where loading of unencrypted symmetric
	key is prohibited.

	FIPS Level 2 is hard to achieve without breaking compatibility so patch
	implements "workaround" to make NSS behave like FIPS Level 1
	(where is allowed to load unencrypted symmetric key).

	Workaround is about using temporal key to encrypt corosync authkey in
	memory and then to unwrap it into valid NSS key.

	Also when FIPS is enabled, it's not currently (nss 3.30.2) possible to
	unwrap key larger than 256 bytes.

	[send/recv] split RX and TX threads in separate files

	[send/recv] split code into separate files (step 1)

	[send/recv] Unify and simplify usage of seq_num in packets
	IMPORTANT: this commit changes onwire protocol in an incompatible way!

	- remove the concet of bcast and mcast seq num and use one tx_seq_num
	- stop using LINK_UP_DOWN messages to broadcast node seq num and
	  transfer this data inside heartbeat messages
	- LINK_UP_DOWN messages are currently unused but let's keep the
	  infrastructure around for future
	- minor cleanup in host_set_policy to confirm change of switching
	  policy in the logs
	- _link_updown should use async call to host dstcache update
	  due to locking context
	- switch knet_link_set_enable to use write locking context
	  since the only reason it was read lock, was due to the need
	  to send LINK_UP_DOWN messages
	- knet_link_set_priority can now use dstcache in sync mode
	- add seq_num and heartbeat type (timed/untimed) data to heartbeat
	  messages. timed messages are generated regularly by hb_thread.
	  untimed messages are generated by the TX thread to sync seq_num
	  on heavy load across all connected node. (see comments in the code)
	- access to the node seq_num is now mutex locked
	- abstract ability to send pings from multiple threads
	- special case seq_num == 0 to detect a node crash and coming back
	  to life before hb_thread can detect the disconnection
	- forcefully send ping in the TX thread every SEQ_MAX / 8 packets
	  to allow nodes to sync seq_num
	- optimize TX thread code to prepare the outgoing buffers once
	  vs multiple times. There is still work that can be done here
	  to optimize sending to multiple host, but this change
	  is intrusive enough already as it is
	- add logic to clear circular buffers when receiving pings

	[host] remove completely broken host to host communication locking system
	the original idea was to have a host-to-host (semi-)reliable communication protocol
	but that just isn't possible without flow control and retransmit

	IIRC the only side affect of this missing lock is a corner case where:
	1) node A totally crashes
	2) node A come backs to life, sends it's status info (seq_num information)
	3) node B does NOT receive the status info
	4) node A starts sending traffic and a few packets might get lost

	     such) in the link struct and link_enable would create sockets and
	     do the magic. This method didn't work well for complex transports
	     such as SCTP and introduced a series of race conditions and deadlocks.

	  The new method:
	   - link_set_config would now store config in link struct AND create
	     all related sockets and such. The link will not be used for data
	     traffic till enabled.
	   - link_set_enable will enable/disable the link for traffic (including
	     heartbeat) and requires a link to be configured (as before)
	   - link_clear_config (new API) can/has to be called after disabling
	     a link to close all connections and sockets (free resources).

	Internal changes:

	- Drop the concept of listeners.* and delegate those to
	  underlying transports.

	- Add the concept of fd_tracker. Each transport is required and it is
	  responsible to update the fd_tracking array for the fd that the
	  transport itself is creating/using/clearing.
	  The fd_tracker is required to perform fast lookups on socket
	  errors and RX thread to determine what code is responsible to parse
	  given conditions such as errors from the sockets or OOB data/notifications.

	- Introduce the concept of link->transport_connected.
	  In case the transport requires socket connection to the other end (SCTP for
	  example), set to 0 while disconnected and set 1 once connected to the other
	  side. This flag will avoid unnecessary errors generated from the TX threads.
	  NOTE: still needs better plumbing around. For now it's only partially used
	        in the heartbeat thread. UDP sets to 1 by default.

	- Rework the transport API to be easier to use.
	  - If a transport is not available, get_XXXX_transport() should return NULL.
	  - A transport that provides &XXXX_transport_ops MUST have all operations
	    implemented as described in internals.h. This is required to skip tons
	    of if/else checks on fast code paths.
	  - Improve documentation of the transport API in internals.h.
	  - transport common: drop some unnecessary functions for now, they might
	    can back later in better format once SCTP is working again.
	  - provide a locked/unlocked version of _set_fd_tracker but this is an
	    artifact of trying to fix SCTP deadlocking. _set_fd_tracker should
	    always be locked.
	  - cleanup transport_udp.c to match the new API and perform better
	    error handling and better cleaning in case of errors.
	  - switch mtu_overhead to constant from call into a function.
	  - drop usage of _transport_addrtostr/_transport_addrtostr_free for all but
	    accepting incoming SCTP connections. All other datas are already available
	    and it's unnecessary to perform extra lookups. This will eventually
	    move to a proper knet_api and avoid completely the need to build with --debug.

	- RX thread:
	  - use the new transport hooks to handle socket errors and
	    determine if a packet is data or internal OOB info.
	  - remove the last transport specific bits and move them into
	    transport implementation itself.

	- Test suite:
	  - Update the test suite to deal with the new API changes
	  - Fix a couple of shutdown problems in knet_bench
	  - Fix a shutdown issue in test-common.c
	  - Document the whole recvmmsg API in details, based on kernel
	    implementation. recvmmsg man page is incorrect.

	- Fix kronosnetd to use the new APIs

2016-11-05  Fabio M. Di Nitto  <fdinitto@redhat.com>

	Add libnss iovec PoC
	this is a small modified version of the code example available here:

	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/nss_sample_code/NSS_Sample_Code_sample2

	to show that it is possible to encrypt from multiple src buffers
	into a final buffer.

	this approach will allow us to remove a lot of memcpy around the
	recv/send thread and replace them with iovec mapping all across.

	Possible side effects:
	- less memory consumption (mapping vs allocating)
	- more complex code / crypto (internal) API changes

	Add poc-code directory and move access-list code from Chrissie there
	Over time we have created a lot of small PoC code to make knet better.
	Most of it is already integrated but other chunks are still floating around.

	I prefer to keep them here so that:

	1) they don't get lost
	2) it will be easier to integrate them once we get to that point
	3) we can share PoC and work on them together

	The original idea was to provide information about real link onwire mtu
	and max user data mtu (that could be sent on wire without fragmentation)
	that adjusted the value for IP protocol, knet header and crypto (if configured).

	Effectively there is no use for the real link onwire mtu and it only involves
	extra complexity to export lots of extra data to the end user that would have
	to redo the calculations internally to gather data mtu.

	[PMTUd] fix several issues around PMTUd and improve discovery performances
	- Fix a race condition around first time MTU discovery where MTU value
	  would be out of the wazooo
	- Fix a case where onwire MTU value would be smaller than crypto header
	  and generate errors

	- Make MTU value a decision factor if a link is usable or not.
	  If MTU is not valid (either the discovery process failed) or
	  the value is not sane, the link will be removed from the available
	  data link pool till the problem is resolved. Once the problem is
	  solved the link will recover automatically.

	- Have link up/down status trigger a PMTUd process to speed up
	  detection.

	- Add ability to detect smaller MTU than minimum defined by protocol.

	- Improve error reporting across the board.

	- Make PMTUd timeout dynamic based on current link latency. This change
	  makes detection of small MTU very fast.

	- Sanity check values returned by PMTUD to be in range between
	  minimum MTU defined by given protocol and maximum that knet can handle.

	- Trigger host cache reculaculation on MTU validity change to reduce
	  risk of packet loss on bad links.

	[send/recv] rework handling of 0 byte read/write on local sockets
	considering there is no obvious use case trying to send 0 byte packets
	and that 0 byte packtes are filtered by iovec calls across the all
	code, there is no point trying to handle 0 byte differently from
	any other socket error.

	this commit makes sure that every time there is an error (-1) or a 0
	byte read from the locally provided sockets, a call back is issued.

	on read errors (-1) the socket will be removed from the epoll
	to avoid spinning and it is safe to call knet_handle_remove_datafd
	afterwards to remove it completely.

	it is now mandatory to enable a sock_notify callback before adding
	datafd.

	read libknet.h carefully on what the callback is supposed to do
	based on the type of socket your application is adding.

	[send/recv] be consistent between readv and recvmmsg handling 0 bytes packets

	[PMTUd] improve debug message to add iface mtu

	[global] add support for multiple local sockets/fds
	WARNING: this commit changes API and onwire protocol

	It is now possible to configure multiple local sockets to send/recv
	data over the same knet handle.

	to every send/recv socket a channel is assigned that behaves more
	or less like a VLAN.
	hostA channel 0 will be delivered to datafd on hostB channel 0
	hostA channel 1 to hostB channel 1
	etc.

	It is possible to configure up to 32 channel, but there is space
	to increase this number if necessary.

	New API calls:
	knet_handle_add_datafd
	knet_handle_remove_datafd
	knet_handle_enable_sock_notify
	knet_handle_get_channel
	knet_handle_get_datafd

	Notification has been added in cases where a local socket is the result
	of accepting a tcp connection that gets disconnected and corrective
	action needs to be taken by the application.

	Changed API calls:
	knet_handle_new
	knet_recv
	knet_send
	knet_handle_enable_filter

	onwire changes:
	add one byte to transport channel information

	channel information are also passed down to the dst_host_filter
	in the event the application has needs to modify that on TX/RX
	events.

	Internal changes:
	cleanup how sockpairs are handled in general to make it simpler
	to map application side and internal side.

	NOTE: callback function has not been properly tested.

	[send/recv] Fix handling of HOSTINFO packets
	HOSTINFO packets are nothing more than special cased DATA packets.

	The contents of HOSTINFO is stored inside DATA of DATA packets and

	to treat the packets as DATA for defragmentation and deduplication.

	This also fixes a problem when using round-robin and active switching
	policy where the HOSTINFO exchange would loop forever in a storm
	because duplicate pckts were being handled at once.

	[crypto] align crypto_authenticate_and_decrypt API to crypto_encrypt_and_sign
	2 issues solved by this change:

	1) API were different and crypto_authenticate_and_decrypt would trash the
	   incoming packet, that we might want to keep for later usage
	   (re-switch for example)

	2) By using an extre pre-allocated buffer while decrypting incoming packets
	   we save a whole memcpy and that reduces latency on crypto communications:

	libtap was closing the parent's pipe() fd twice. Sometimes, between the
	first and second close, that fd gets reopened by the logging thread as
	PF_LOCAL, and used for logging.

	Then libtap wakes up again after the fork and closes the fd thinking
	it's its pipe fd. knet then opens it again as AF_INET for pinging.

	libqb logging then errors on a sendto() and closes it AGAIN, and reopens
	it as a PF_LOCAL logging fd. Ping then has a brain haemorrage next time
	it comes round to calling sendto().

	[host] move dst cache updates to the right logging subsystem

	Update TODO list

	[host] create dst_cache sync and async functions and fix link lookup race condition
	Prior to this change, there was a potential race condition in which, when shutting
	down a link, the destination cache would not be updated in time and pckts would
	be lost in an invalid socket.

	This change introduced a sync version of the dst cache update and protects
	outgoing traffic socket lookup with a mutex.

	The only downside of this change is that, in future, when we will introduce
	complex switching algorithms, we might have to spend a bit more time
	recalculating the network topology on link shutdown and halt traffic switching.

	Pro is that we have a smaller gap in lost traffic when reconfiguring the local

	gather host info for all incoming pkcts (data/ping) since there
	is no point to go crazy figuring it out

	add basic ring buffer functions based on playground implementation
	(still missing reset of the buffer)

	kronosnetd: fix data initialization
	we can't memset knet_link because khost_add does some initialization
	there that we overwrite otherwise.

	drop incorrect clean up path. knet_links are not malloc'ed but statically
	allocated.

2012-09-27  Fabio M. Di Nitto  <fdinitto@redhat.com>

	kronosnetd: remove spurios debugging messages

	libknet: add seq_num to sender host
	bcast for packets that needs to be sent to all nodes
	ucast for direct packets

	the difference is necessary to avoid unncessary re-encryption
	of packets. This will make more sense once packet inspector
	is in place, but basically seq_num are per host and not all
	packets will go everywhere, creating undesirable holes in the
	packet_ring_buffer, that in turns, in a non-encrypted network
	could lead to some annoyance.

	libknet: change packet definitions to include seq_num for data packets
	this is required for pckt deduplication

	libvty is not going to happen. Too complex and it's not the goal

	build: update configure.ac after autoscan

	build: fix make dist

	vty: remove concept of auto-listeners/manual listeners
	switch to a much simpler baseport and port range concept.

	for now, only baseport is implementend and needs extra checks implementation.
	portrange will come soon enough.

	ring: fix ping calculation for good
	finally I have been able to reproduce the problem and it's related to
	the "unknown" source in MONOTONIC clock. It can rollover making the signed
	comparison useless. Force unsigned long long for the calculation that
	fixes the issue.

	Switching from:
	Notice: timediff: -345483470 interval: 1000000

	To:
	Notice: timediff: 18446744073387515858 interval: 1000000

	ring: use long long instead of suseconds_t
	it appears (but not totally sure) that suseconds_t is not easily portable.
	On sparc it was showing, at random, some different behaviour.
