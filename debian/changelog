kronosnet (1.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * [39a7e15] Revert "GCC already uses SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH"
    This reverts commit 7611955b1e867624f3f1ab6810e3434c544426d0.
    Since configure adds -Werror to CFLAGS by default, the -Wdate-time added
    by dpkg-buildflags broke the build, but unnecessarily: modern gcc
    already uses SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH, so reproducibility wasn't broken.
    However, setting CFLAGS directly wasn't a good idea, since it dropped
    the useful (mostly hardening) options as well.
    As the __TIME__ and __DATE__ macros are used in the kronosnetd code
    only, which isn't compiled by default, this setting had better go.
